# Lesson 01

* HTML as a collection of nested boxes

* Colors and font sizes in CSS

* JavaScript string functions

## Project: The plural form of animals

* Create a simple HTML page with a text input (give it an ID) that should accept an animal's name.

* After clicking on a button, another part of the page will show the plural form of that animal.

* For example, typing "rat" should result in "rats", and "mouse" in "mice".

* Add a few other of these irregular forms, such as goose (geese), fish (fish), and ox (oxen).

* Example:

```
Enter an animal: [ pig ]

The plural of "pig" is "pigs".
```

* Use `length` and `substr` (second argument is the number of characters).

* Use an object to store the irregular plural forms, and check this object first.

* Consider which ending consonants require adding "-es" instead of just "s".

* Use vanilla JS to convert the input.

* Use CSS to style the computed result.

* Bonus: detect if the input is already plural.

* Bonus 2: allow placing an adjective before the animal (fat pigs)
