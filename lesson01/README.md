# Lesson 01: The plural of a few animals

## The Task

* Create a simple HTML page with a text input that displays the plural form of an animal.

* For example, typing "rat" should result in "rats", and "mouse" in "mice".

* Add a few of these irregular forms.

```
Enter an animal: [ pig ]

The plural of pig is pigs.
```

* Bonus: detect if the input is already plural.

* Use length and substr (second argument is the number of characters).

* Use an object to store the plural forms, and check this object first.

* Use vanilla JS to convert the input.

* Use CSS to style the computed result.
